## General Information
- This project is about helping Lending Club predict clients who are more likely to default, so that they can charge them a higher interest rate, etc.
- We're using the Loan Data provided by Upgrad Team

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We created a new column called "Credit Score" which consists of 11 different factors, which would help them predict wether clients would default or not
- We conducted Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate analysis and have written our findings in the PPT.
